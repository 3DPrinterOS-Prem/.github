## ❓ What is 3DPrinterOS?

**3DPrinterOS** is a cloud-based operating system for 3D printers. It allows users to manage slicing, queuing, monitoring, and printing across multiple devices — all from a web browser.

The platform is ideal for **schools, universities, makerspaces, and industrial print farms** that require centralized access control, usage analytics, and collaborative workflows.

Key advantages include:

- **Remote slicing and print scheduling**  
- **Live monitoring via camera or status feedback**  
- **Cloud storage of 3D models (STL, OBJ)**  
- **Team-based access and role permissions**  
- **Analytics and reporting dashboards**  
- **Secure queueing and print job approval flows**

3DPrinterOS supports many popular printers from **Ultimaker, MakerBot, Creality, Prusa, Raise3D**, and others. A local Windows client runs in the background and connects the hardware to the cloud.
